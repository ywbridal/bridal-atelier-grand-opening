# Step 1, Get an AI assistant to do the technical part

**This is the first thing to do, before anything else.** Not because the
rest is hard, but because there's no reason for you to spend your
evenings on it.

The plan for this whole project:

```
   ┌──────────────────────────┐         ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │  Your AI assistant       │         │  You, in the editor       │
   │  (Claude Code / Codex)   │         │  (visual, click-and-drag) │
   ├──────────────────────────┤         ├───────────────────────────┤
   │  • installs everything   │         │  • your names, your words │
   │  • sets up the site      │         │  • colors, sizes, spacing │
   │  • publishes it online   │         │  • your photos            │
   │  • adds new sections     │  ◀────▶ │  • looking at it and      │
   │  • fixes what's broken   │         │    deciding what's wrong  │
   │  • anything technical    │         │  • checking it on a phone │
   └──────────────────────────┘         └───────────────────────────┘
         does the work                       makes the decisions
```

You are the art director. The assistant is the entire technical
department. That division is the point, and it's why you don't need to
learn git, or the terminal, or HTML, to end up with a site you're proud
of.

## Which one?

Either works. Both cost about the same, both are excellent at this.

| | Cost *(verified July 2026, check current pricing)* | The tool |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Pro** | ~$20/month | **Claude Code** |
| **ChatGPT Plus** | ~$20/month | **Codex** |

One month is plenty to finish a wedding site. Cancel afterwards if you
want, the site keeps running, it doesn't depend on the subscription.

**The $100–200/month tiers are not needed here.** Those are for people
writing software all day. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

## Setting up Claude Code

**The least technical route: the desktop app.** Claude Code comes as a
Mac and Windows app, and as a web app at
[claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code), no terminal involved. If the
words "command line" make you tired, start there: install it, sign in
with your Claude account, and point it at your project folder.

**If you're comfortable in the Terminal** (or your assistant tells you
to), the command-line version is one line:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then, from inside your project folder:

```bash
claude
```

It'll walk you through signing in the first time.

## Setting up Codex

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Then, from inside your project folder:

```bash
codex
```

Same idea: it asks you to sign in with your ChatGPT account on first run.

> **Both of those need Node.js first.** If `npm` isn't recognized
> install the **LTS** version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), a
> normal installer, like any other app, then close and reopen the
> Terminal.
>
> Or: skip it, use the Claude Code desktop app, and let the assistant
> tell you what it needs.

---

## The very first thing to ask it

Once it's running **in your project folder**, this single message gets
you from nothing to a live website:

> I've just copied a wedding invite starter kit into this folder. I'm not
> a developer, please do the technical setup for me.
>
> Read the README.md first so you understand what this project is. Then:
> check I have everything installed that this needs, get the site
> publishing to GitHub Pages, and tell me the web address when it's live.
>
> Explain each step in plain language as you go, and ask me before
> anything that can't be undone.

That's it. That's the setup. It will install what's missing, handle git
turn on hosting, and hand you a URL.

**Then, and only then**, you open the visual editor and start making it
yours, see **[HOW-TO-USE-THE-EDITOR.md](HOW-TO-USE-THE-EDITOR.md)**.

## How to get good results

These are the habits that make the difference between "the AI messed up
my site" and "I finished it in a weekend."

**1. Point it at file names.**
"In `index.html` and `css/style.css`…", vague requests get vague
results. Naming the file focuses it immediately.

**2. Describe the outcome, not the method.**
✅ *"Make the whole thing feel warmer, less black-tie, more sunny
garden party."*
❌ *"Change font-family to Playfair and set the background to #FDF6E3."*

You're the art director. Directors describe what they want to see, not
which knobs to turn. The second version also caps the result at whatever
you already knew to ask for.

**3. Tell it to look at the result.**
> "Run the site locally, look at it on a phone-sized screen, and show
> me a screenshot before you change anything else."

These assistants can start the site, open a browser, and actually *see*
the page. An assistant that looks catches things an assistant that only
types will miss.

**4. Say what must not break.**
> "Don't change the countdown, the RSVP form, or the photo gallery
> just the colors."

This project has moving parts (the countdown timer, the RSVP form, the
photo lightbox) that live in `js/main.js`. Naming them as off-limits is
cheap insurance.

**5. Point it at this project's own documentation.**
> "Read `editor/README.md` before you touch the CSS, it documents
> constraints specific to this project."

Those files were written partly *for* an AI assistant to read. There are
real, documented quirks in here (certain CSS shorthand properties get
dropped by the visual editor; the countdown depends on specific ids).
An assistant that's read those notes won't rediscover them the hard way
on your live site.

**6. Work in small steps, and look after each one.**
One change → look at it → next change. It's tempting to ask for ten
things at once; you'll get a better site asking for one thing ten times
because you're steering after every step.

**7. Paste errors exactly as they appear.**
Whole message, unedited. This is where these tools genuinely shine
an error that would cost you an evening of searching is often a
ten-second fix for them.

## Trust it to work. Verify the result.

Letting an assistant do the technical work does **not** mean clicking
"yes" without looking. You don't need to read code to verify well
you need to check the things you're actually qualified to judge, which
happen to be the things that matter most:

- **Look at the site yourself** after each change. You'll spot "that
  doesn't look right" faster than any tool.
- **Check it on your actual phone**, not just a phone-sized window.
- **Ask it to explain what it did**, in plain words: *"explain that
  change as if I don't code."* If the explanation doesn't make sense to
  you, that's worth a follow-up question, not because it's necessarily
  wrong, but because you should understand your own website.
- **Ask to see before publishing**: *"show me first, don't publish yet."*
- **Test the RSVP form yourself**, by actually submitting one. This is
  the single most important thing on the site and the easiest to get
  subtly wrong.

**Your undo button is git**, and it's better than you'd expect. Every
published version is saved. If a change makes things worse, you can
always say:

> "That's worse, undo it and go back to how it was before."

and it can. Nothing here is one-way.

**One hard rule:** never paste passwords, credit card numbers, or
security tokens into a chat, and don't let an assistant put them in a
file. Legitimate setup (like signing into GitHub) happens in your own
browser, not by handing over a password.

## What to do when it gets stuck

It happens. Two things that reliably unstick it:

1. **Show it the evidence.** *"The site loads but there's no styling at
   all"* is more useful than *"it's broken."* Even better: *"here's the
   exact error message: [paste]"*.
2. **Let it look for itself.** *"Open the site and check the browser
   console for errors."* It can do that.

And if a whole approach turns out wrong: *"scrap that, let's go back to
the last working version and try something different."* Cheap to do
and often faster than debugging a bad path.

---

## Where the assistant ends and you begin

Not everything should go to the assistant. Once the site is set up and
live, small visual changes are genuinely **faster to do yourself** in
the editor, you see the result instantly instead of describing it
waiting, and looking.

That boundary, what's worth doing yourself, what's worth handing over
and how far you can realistically push, is laid out with concrete
examples in
**[HOW-TO-USE-THE-EDITOR.md](HOW-TO-USE-THE-EDITOR.md#the-division-of-labor)**.

That's the next thing to read.
