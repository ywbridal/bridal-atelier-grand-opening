"""
Local server for the GrapesJS editor. Standard library only, no
dependency beyond Python 3.

Serves the static files (the real site + the editor's own assets) and
handles POST /save to write the changes made in the canvas.

Usage:
    python3 editor/server.py [port]      (default: 8767)

Doesn't publish anything on its own: it only writes to disk. `git push`
stays a separate, deliberate step, see scripts/publish.sh.
